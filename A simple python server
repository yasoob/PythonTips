I guess it’s not a simple python server. It is really simple and easy to deploy python server. Just imagine you want to share a folder on your pc with someone on your network. What you will do ? Obviously you will start the sharing service but what if you have python installed and want an easier solution ? Here you go. You can just type in :

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
This should be typed in the terminal or command prompt if you are a windows guy. Just open command prompt. Navigate to the directory which you want to share and then run this command. Unlike the normal sharing services this server will also show you the IP addresses of the PCs which are accessing that folder. Pretty slick right ?
